Magic commands can be used to control the interpreter's behavior in interactive mode:

- `%% [shell commands, like ls or cd]`: Run commands in Open Interpreter's shell instance
- `%verbose [true/false]`: Toggle verbose mode. Without arguments or with 'true', it enters verbose mode. With 'false', it exits verbose mode.
- `%reset`: Reset the current session.
- `%undo`: Remove previous messages and its response from the message history.
- `%save_message [path]`: Saves messages to a specified JSON path. If no path is provided, it defaults to 'messages.json'.
- `%load_message [path]`: Loads messages from a specified JSON path. If no path is provided, it defaults to 'messages.json'.
- `%tokens [prompt]`: EXPERIMENTAL: Calculate the tokens used by the next request based on the current conversation's messages and estimate the cost of that request; optionally provide a prompt to also calulate the tokens used by that prompt and the total amount of tokens that will be sent with the next request.
- `%info`: Show system and interpreter information.
- `%help`: Show this help message.
- `%jupyter`: Export the current session to a Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) to the Downloads folder.
